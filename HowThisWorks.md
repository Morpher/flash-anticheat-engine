# Why #

I made this library for a friend. He was doing a game with prizes for the top scores and needed to avoid cheating. To be honest any client-side game can be hacked, hackers gonna hack, but at least I can increase the threshold of knowledge required to cheat.

# The Problem #

The main problem are memory editors like t-search and cheat-engine which today they are very popular and easy to use. You can see many videos on `YouTube` teaching how to cheat games.

# How this works ? #

The library provides you with secure variables
  * Very difficult to find using memory editors
  * Fake results to mislead cheaters
  * [TO-DO] Notify the game when the user is trying to cheat
