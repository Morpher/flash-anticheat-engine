# Flash Anticheat Engine

This AS3 library will help developers to protect their games to memory editors and basic hacking attempts.

The purpose of this library is to provide developers with tools to protect the game's client-side from memory editors, cheaters and hacking attempts.
It's impossible to fully protect the client-side of a game but it's possible to increase the threshold of knowledge required to cheat.

Features:
Secure variables from memory editors.
Games can detect external changes from memory editors, lock the game and report the users.
